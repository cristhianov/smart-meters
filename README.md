Project Smart meter data analysis from London area.

Overview

⚪ This project is a data analysis from the London data store, that contains the energy consumption readings for a sample of 5,567 London Households that took part in the UK Power Networks led Low Carbon London project. 

⚪ After this initial study, the British government decided to adopt smart meters as part of their plan to update our ageing energy system. 


To better follow the energy consumption, it is indispensable that governments in any country aim to the energy suppliers to install smart meters as part of measures to upgrade our energy supply by optimizing the power distribution, minimizing operation expenses as well as tackle climate change.

This project is a data analysis of a dataset from the London data store, that contains the energy consumption readings for a sample of 5,567 London Households that took part in the UK Power Networks led Low Carbon London project between November 2011 and February 2014. The data from the smart meters seems associated only to the electrical consumption: After this initial study, the British government decided to adopt smart meters as part of their plan to update our ageing energy system.
